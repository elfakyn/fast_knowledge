# Stuck resolving host

Try the following:

**Option 1:** Go to **[chrome://net-internals/#dns](chrome://net-internals/#dns)** and click "Clear host cache".

**Option 2:** It may be related to MalwareBytes. But don't know how to fix it short of uninstalling MB. Good luck and PR a change if you found a fix!

That's all I got so far.

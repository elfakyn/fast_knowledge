# Fast Knowledge

No bullshit documentation. Only what you need, copy paste snippets, and the like, with short explanations.

This will hopefully reduce the incidence of spaghetti factories.

## You use "spaghetti factory" a lot. What's it mean?

It's something that tricks you into fucking up.

Real-life examples include:
* NPM's "Add account to organization" feature used to look like a search box. People thought they were searching for "JohnnyBravo" in our NPM org but all they were doing was adding "joh" "john" and "johnny" to the org, with no confirmation dialog.
* A command that's destructive by default with a `-d` flag that means "nondestructive"
* The "Quit Sibelius" button
